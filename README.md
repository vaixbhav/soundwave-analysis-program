Developed Java program to work with sound, especially sound datatypes. Implemented diverse range of operations on sound waves for wave analysis including:

- Adding echoes;
- Implementing a high-pass filter to remove low frequency noise from audio;
- Supporting the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation on a sound wave;
- Comparing two sound waves;
- Grouping music by structural similarity.

The program supports both MP3 and WAV files to analyze and sound waves can be visualized using Swing, a GUI tool in Java.
